Improve rockspec to create a rock, so that it could be easilly downloaded.
Add  "--test" option, so that it would be possible, to get CPU,GPU temps, PWM issued, and fanctl state, on terminal.
Add support for SysVinit systems.

v0.1.7 - master
improve start/stop trigger points. DONE Parcially( will depend on profiles feature..)
Create 2 profiles for small and taller fans, with one point of configuration.
	It will then be easier to adjust fan power, speed,vibrations..
	Initial 2 targets{ 10mm tall, 20 mm tall fans }.Done Partially(Done only inside envelope to adjust fan, PWM,Quiet and Run values remain the same outside..)
improve makefile, to stop systemd service, compile/install shared library, enable service,
	and start it after install process- DONE( systemd OK, not yet for SysVinit :( ... )

v0.1.6 - released
Start/Stop trip points. - DONE
improve makefile, to do the work needed on systemd service, and install process, including creating new symlinks, which lead to do not have broken links.. - DONE
Create initial rockspec, so that it will be easier to download/compile/install from master...in one simple command. DONE

v0.1.5 - released
Simplify the looping process code, speed it up.. DONE
Change Curve response, adjust it do be calculated before, the looping process start, will improove speed amd less resources used..DONE
Improve Makefile 'all' target.DONE
Improve Makefile 'install' target.DONE
Improve Makefile 'clean' target.DONE
Add Target 'purge' to Makefile( to remove the code after installation, used with manual instalation...git clone method.. ), see README. DONE

v0.1.4 - released
rewrite all parts were fork+exec were taking place, and use new Library module code. DONE
add Shalid library module in C language for sleeping operations. DONE
Create makefile, so that fanctl will be sleeping, triggering a preemptive exit of program, and freeing CPU for other tasks. DONE.
improve fanctl, so that it will only update values of diferent ones required. DONE.
( ... ). Done.
